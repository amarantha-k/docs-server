= Function: Basic bucket Ops
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition
:tabs:

*Goal*: Perform the basic bucket operations where Eventing interacts with the Data service..

* This function *basicBucketOps* merely demonstrates basic Evening BucketOps.
* Requires a metdata bucket, a source bucket, and a bucket called "destination"
* Needs a Binding of type Bucket Alias (as documented in the Scriptlet).
* Will operate on any mutation of the KEY "basic_bkt_ops::1".
* The final document is delete, so we are interest in the Application log file (newest first).
* For more detail refer to xref:eventing:eventing-language-constructs.html#bucket_accessors[Bucket Accessors]
